  <h2>Since Monday is Halloween, shouldn’t today be the start of a three-day weekend?</h2>

<p style="color:brown;font-size:25px"><strong>I realize Halloween doesn’t summon up the same feelings that honoring brave soldiers, departed leaders, and the American labor movement might, but you’ll have to admit it’s almost as pervasive in our culture. Supermarkets and convenience stores are overstocked with scary-clown masks and Donald Trump disguises — alas, I repeat myself — and you can’t switch on your TV or go to your local cinema complex without encountering traditional scare fests (like “House of Wax”) or newer fright films (like “Blair Witch”).

Halloween is Labor Day for kids. Just as an adult may use the latter as a reason to fire up the Weber and keep the beer and pork industries alive, Halloween lets a kid dress up as someone or something else — and, later, to inhale enough candy to put even the heartiest pancreas at risk.
Yet kids don’t get to stay home from school on Halloween. They only do on adult holidays. This is patently unfair (I tossed in the word “patently” so you’d know I’m a serious essayist. If I had said “sort of” unfair, you might have doubted my commitment to the topic).

Actually, what would really be fair would be to let kids stay home from school the day after Halloween, as they deal with their first sugar hangovers — which can be just as miserable as alcohol hangovers but candy doesn’t cause most kids to forget the previous evening’s activities. Nor, while under the influence, do they usually text old girlfriends or boyfriends and either beg for another chance or call them pigs. (Only Donald Trump does that — and he, we’re told, doesn’t drink. Leading me to wonder: maybe he should?)

Since banks and government offices close for adult holidays, kids should be accorded similar courtesies on Halloween. In addition to closing schools, officials should ban the sale of broccoli, attendance at a performance of Wagner’s entire “The Ring Cycle” and anyone from asking the kids how they’re enjoying school. It would be like asking adults on Labor Day if they’re looking forward to getting back to their jobs the next morning.

One final note: As you know, most kids don’t have a “trick” ready when they give you the option of trick or treat. Since the only choice adults are faced with at a Labor Day barbecue, for example, is whether they want coleslaw or sea-foam Jell-O mold with their wienies, let’s just have the kids say, “Get the Kit Kat bars. Now.” The evening will go much faster, I assure you.
